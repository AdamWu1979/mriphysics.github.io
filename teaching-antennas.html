## Magnetic Field Patterns from Hertzian Dipole Antenna

<img src="images/HzDipole_3D.gif" width="50%">


The antenna is at the centre and oriented vertically. The magnetic field points in the
azimuthal direction, and the colours indicate the strengths of the field (red is
  positive, blue is negative, green is zero).

### A line in the horizontal plane through the antenna:

The total field can be decomposed into a radiative term (dies as 1/r) and near field term (dies as 1/r^2). At distances of over a wavelength from the antenna the radiative term dominates.

Zooming in much closer to the antenna we see that the 'near field' term dominates. The field oscillates in magnitude but doesn't exhibit traveling wave behaviour. Notice that the near field and far field terms have a 90 degree phase difference.



## Reflections and method of images

This material is from the tutorial. The images show the magnitude of the *electric* field from a half wavelength dipole antenna.

#### Vertically oriented dipole:

Left = without ground, centre = fields from image (i.e. reflections), right = total field.

#### Horitzontally oriented dipole:

<img src="images/HW_horiz_noground.gif" width="30%"><img src="images/HW_horiz_image.gif" width="30%"><img src="images/HW_horiz_combo.gif" width="30%">

Left = without ground, centre = fields from image (i.e. reflections), right = total field.

For the horizontal orientation the fields are exactly zero at the ground.
